Git Branching Style 

SUMMARY: In order to have an agreed-upon Git Branching style we decided to use OneFlow with rebasing rather than merging. 

PROBLEM: In using Git, we need an organized way to keep track of changes to our code, and to “tell the story” of the app’s development over time. 

CONSTRAINTS: We are not too well versed with Git, so we need something that is simple, easy to follow, and logical. 

OPTIONS: 

OneFlow with rebasing 
Pros: Linear history, easier to understand 
Cons: Reverting entire feature requires reverting multiple commits 
OneFlow with merging 
Pros: Only one commit is required to revert entire feature 
Cons: History could be messy and hard to understand 
RATIONALE: We would like to make the history easier to understand by readers as other teams may want to create their own application to control the device, and a linear history could be better to follow. A linear history also helps us when writing our documentation that will be included in a research paper.
